-- IN THIS FILE WE CAN WRITE AN SQL SCRIPT CONTAINING:
-- SCHEMA, TABLE AND DATA MANIPULATION QUERIES
-- TO BE EXECUTED AUTOMATICALLY DURING THE INITIALIZATION OF THE APPLICATION
-- AND AFTER THE CREATION OF SCHEMA AND TABLES BY Hibernate
-- IF spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto IS SET TO create OR create-drop
-- IT IS A Hibernate feature (nothing to do with Spring)
